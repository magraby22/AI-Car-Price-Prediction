# AI-Car-Price-Prediction
Overview
This project predicts car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more. The goal is to create a reliable machine learning model to provide accurate price predictions.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for training by handling missing or inconsistent values.
Model Development: Built a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression or other algorithms) for price prediction.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using metrics like accuracy or mean absolute error (MAE).
# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preparation.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning model
